    <h1>AIPHAZ Privacy Statement</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: August 20th, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      AIPHAZ TECHNOLOGY PTE. LTD. (“AIPHAZ”, “we”, “our”) operates a global advertising technology platform that helps app developers and publishers deliver more relevant and efficient digital advertising experiences. We believe privacy and transparency are essential parts of that process.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What We Collect — and Why</h2>
    <p>
      When our technology is integrated into mobile apps or websites, it may receive limited information from users’ devices. This information helps us decide which ad to show, measure its performance, and keep the ad ecosystem fair and safe.
    </p>
    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information (e.g., model, operating system, user agent, IP address);</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers (IDFA, GAID, or OAID);</li>
      <li>Approximate location (city or region);</li>
      <li>Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks, views).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other directly identifying details of end users.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a business partner (publisher, advertiser, or demand partner), we may collect contact and billing information necessary to maintain our business relationship.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What We Don’t Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We don’t sell, rent, or trade user data.</li>
      <li>We don’t track users across unrelated apps for personal profiling.</li>
      <li>We don’t knowingly process data from children under 13 (or the relevant local minimum age).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deliver, verify, and measure digital ads;</li>
      <li>Detect invalid or fraudulent traffic;</li>
      <li>Produce aggregated reporting for our partners;</li>
      <li>Improve system performance and reliability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our data use follows the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and minimalism — we collect only what’s necessary to make advertising work responsibly.
    </p>

    <h2>5. How We Protect Data</h2>
    <p>
      AIPHAZ applies strict access control, encryption, and continuous monitoring to secure the data we process. We also require our vendors and partners to meet comparable privacy and security standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data logs are retained for a short period (typically under <span class="highlight">14 days</span>) and then deleted or anonymized.
    </p>

    <h2>6. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Because our services operate globally, data may be processed on servers located in several countries. When personal data is transferred outside the European Economic Area or other regulated regions, we rely on legally recognized safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re an end user and want to exercise these rights, please contact the app developer who uses our SDK or advertising services — they are in the best position to identify your data.
    </p>
